# 🎮 Text-Based Adventure Game (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **text-based adventure game** developed using **Python** as part of the Purdue AI/ML program.  
The game allows players to explore different locations, make choices, encounter challenges, and complete a simple quest through an interactive **command-line interface (CLI)**.

The primary goal of this project is to reinforce **core Python programming concepts** while demonstrating how **GitHub Copilot** can assist in writing, optimizing, and structuring code efficiently.
